analyze_requirements:
  description: >
    Analyze the user's requirements for their AI agent using Gemini.
    
    User wants to build:
    - Agent Type: {agent_type}
    - Use Case: {use_case}
    - Desired Model: {desired_model}
    - Personality: {personality}
    - Target Framework: {target_framework}
    - Additional Requirements: {additional_requirements}
    
    Your task:
    1. Recommend the best Gemini model (gemini-pro, gemini-1.5-flash, gemini-1.5-pro)
    2. Define the agent configuration including model settings
    3. Outline technical requirements
    4. Consider that Gemini is FREE with long context windows and fast inference
    
    Provide your analysis in a structured format that includes:
    - Recommended Gemini model and why
    - Agent configuration (name, type, model, personality)
    - Technical specifications (temperature, max tokens, etc.)
    - Any special considerations
  expected_output: >
    A detailed configuration analysis with model recommendation,
    agent settings, and technical specifications.

create_system_prompt:
  description: >
    Based on the previous agent's analysis, create an optimized system prompt for Gemini.
    
    The user wants a {personality} {agent_type} for: {use_case}
    Target model: {desired_model}
    
    Your task:
    1. Write a clear, effective system prompt optimized for Gemini models
    2. Include personality traits and behavioral guidelines
    3. Add relevant constraints and safety guidelines
    4. Use techniques that work well with Gemini (clear roles, structured instructions)
    
    Remember Gemini works best with:
    - Clear role definitions
    - Specific behavioral guidelines  
    - Conversational tone
    - Structured instructions
    
    Output the complete system prompt that will be used for the agent.
  expected_output: >
    A production-ready system prompt optimized for Gemini, along with
    brief notes on techniques used.

generate_code:
  description: >
    Generate production-ready code using Gemini API for a {agent_type}.
    
    Based on the previous agents' work, generate complete working code for {target_framework}.
    
    Your task:
    1. Generate complete working code for {target_framework}
    2. Use appropriate SDK:
       - React/Node: @google/generative-ai package
       - Python: google-generativeai package
    3. Include proper error handling and retry logic
    4. Add environment variable configuration
    5. Include usage examples and comments
    
    The code should be production-ready and copy-paste ready.
    Include all necessary files: main code, package.json/requirements.txt, .env example, README.
  expected_output: >
    Complete code package with main file, dependencies file, 
    environment example, and README with setup instructions.
